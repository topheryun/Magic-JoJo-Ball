# Magic-JoJo-Ball
A (hopefully) simple website that functions as a Magic Eight Ball. You ask a yes or no question and receive and answer. The twist is that the answer is in the form of a JoJo meme.
This project is a collaboration between myself and an ex-classmate for submission at Silly Hacks hackathon.
